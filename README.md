# Self Learning Snake Game

A replication of the classic snake game where the snake learns to live longer while scoring points

```This project was not developed using version control. Hence, the project is quite unstructured, spread across multiple directories, with aberrant naming conventions and redundancies. I'm working on structuring and refactoring the existing source code, testing, adding examples, comments, and documentation. Initially, I'll upload relevant files as I find them, then I'll work on the improvements. I plan to finish the work in a few days.```
