# Self Learning Snake Game

A replication of the classic snake game where the snake learns to live longer while scoring points

```This project was not made using version control. Hence, the existing source code has several redundant files with small differences. I'm working on structuring and refactoring the existing source code, and adding comments and documentation.```

```The existing source code is producing errors, mostly due to improper variable names, occurring due to some incomplete modifications made previously, which is pretty hard to follow. So, I'm rewriting the application in Processing 3; should be done in a couple of days.```
